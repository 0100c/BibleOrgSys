# Abbreviations:
#   XML = eXtensible Markup Language -- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML
#   DTD = Document Type Definition -- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition
#   RNG = Relax NG schema (REgular LAnguage for XML Next Generation) -- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELAX_NG
#   RNC = RNG compact syntax -- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELAX_NG#Compact_syntax
#   JSON = JavaScript Object Notation -- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
#
#
# Enclosed are four sets of files:
#
#   DataFiles/BookOrders/BibleBookOrder_xxx.xml (where xxx is the name of the book order system)
#       A UTF-8 XML file which specifies which book codes are included in a particular publication, and in what order.
#           See the comments at the beginning of the file itself for the most up-to-date information on the file contents.
#       The file also includes an internal DTD. To validate the XML on Linux systems, use
#           xmllint --noout --valid DataFiles/BookOrders/BibleBookOrder_xxx.xml
#               (If it gives no output or error messages, then it has validated.)
#       The file includes an OSIS style header record. (See PDF file at http://bibletechnologies.net)
#           Note though, that we use the xsd:date style with hyphens not with periods as per OSIS.
#           Note also that you might have to expand the internal DTD and the Relax NG schema if you add additional fields to the header.
#
#   DataFiles/BookOrders/BibleBookOrder.rnc
#       A RelaxNG Compact Syntax schema file
#       On Linux, to convert to RNG, use
#           trang DataFiles/BookOrders/BibleBookOrder.rnc DerivedFiles/BibleBookOrder.rng
#       On Linux, to validate against the .rng file, use
#           xmllint --noout --relaxng DerivedFiles/BibleBookOrder.rng DataFiles/BookOrders/BibleBookOrder_xxx.xml (where xxx is the name of the book order system)
#       or better still, to validate against both this and the internal DTD, use
#           xmllint --noout --relaxng DerivedFiles/BibleBookOrder.rng --valid DataFiles/BookOrders/BibleBookOrder_xxx.xml
#
#   BibleBookOrders.py (for Python 3)
#       This small program will load and do some very basic checking of the XML data file.
#           It contains three classes -- the Converter class is not intended to be used by most end-user programs.
#       It can be used in a larger Python program to load the XML data into a number of Python dictionaries (with different fields as the key).
#       It can also be used to convert and export the XML data directly to Python or C code which can be included in another program as well as JSON format
#           (if you don't want to have to supply or validate the master XML file).
#       It is expected that the user might want to modify the Python code in order to customize it to your particular needs for either of the above strategies.
#       The program is open source with a GPL-3.0 licence.
#       If you have Python3 installed on Linux, run the program with ./BibleBookOrders.py --help (once you have made the program file "executable").
#               (Alternatively, try: python3 BibleBookOrders.py --help)
#       To export the data in other formats, use --export (instead of --help).
#           This should load and check the XML file and create BibleBookOrders_Tables.* files in the DerivedFiles folder, suitable for including in other programs.
#       If the program is run without any additional parameters, it runs in a demo mode which should show the use of some of the available routines.
#
#   Tests/BibleBookOrdersTests.py (for Python 3)
#       Running this program from the command line will automatically run tests on the above module, listing tests which fail.
#           A result of OK indicates that the tests have all passed.
#       If you have Python3 installed on Linux, run the program with Tests/BibleBookOrdersTests.py (once you have made the program file "executable").
#               (Alternatively, try: python3 Tests/BibleBookOrdersTests.py)
#       Note that although the --help switch works, most of the other displayed options are included for compatibility reasons only, and do not function correctly.
