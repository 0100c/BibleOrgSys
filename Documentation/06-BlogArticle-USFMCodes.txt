USFM Codes

Unified Standard Format Markers (http://paratext.ubs-translations.org/usfm) are a system of short alphanumeric markers (which follow backslashes in text files) used by UBS (http://www.biblesociety.org/) and SIL (http://sil.org/) to encode Bible translations. Each book is usually stored in a separate file. (In floppy disk days, it was each chapter.) USFM is mostly used by the Paratext editor (http://paratext.ubs-translations.org/about/pt) for Bible translations in progress.

The XML data file and scripts uploaded today are the simple beginnings of a framework to allow access to folders containing USFM texts. USFMMarkers.py loads and converts the XML file containing USFM codes, and provides some simple look-up functions. USFMFilenames.py accepts a folder name and searches for USFM files in that folder. All very simple, but hopefully another small step forwards.
